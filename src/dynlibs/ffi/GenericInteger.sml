Description

val toLarge : int -> LargeInt.int
val fromLarge : LargeInt.int -> int

    These convert between integer values of types int and
    LargeInt.int. The latter raises Overflow if the value does not
    fit.

    Int<M>.fromLarge o Int<N>.toLarge converts an integer from type
    Int<N>.int to Int<M>.int.

val toInt : int -> Int.int
val fromInt : Int.int -> int

    These convert between integer values of types int and the default
    integer type. They raise Overflow if the value does not fit.

val precision : Int.int option

    If SOME(n), this denotes the number n of significant bits in type
    int, including the sign bit. If it is NONE, int has arbitrary
    precision. The precision need not necessarily be a power of two.

val minInt : int option
val maxInt : int option

    The minimal (most negative) and the maximal (most positive)
    integers, respectively, representable by int. If a value is NONE,
    int can represent all negative (respectively, positive) integers,
    within the limits of the heap size.

    If precision is SOME(n), then we have minInt = -2(n-1) and maxInt
    = 2(n-1) - 1.

val + : int * int -> int
val - : int * int -> int
val * : int * int -> int

    These functions return the sum, difference, and product,
    respectively, of the arguments. They raise Overflow when the
    result is not representable.

i div j

    returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the quotient of
    i by j, i.e., floor(((i / j))). It raises Overflow when the result
    is not representable, or Div when j = 0. Note that rounding is
    towards negative infinity, not zero.

i mod j

    returns the remainder of the division of i by j. It raises Div
    when j = 0. When defined, (i mod j) has the same sign as j, and

        (i div j) * j + (i mod j) = i

quot (i, j)

    returns the truncated quotient of the division of i by j, i.e., it
    computes (i / j) and then drops any fractional part of the
    quotient. It raises Overflow when the result is not representable,
    or Div when j = 0. Note that unlike div, quot rounds towards
    zero. In addition, unlike div and mod, neither quot nor rem are
    infix by default; an appropriate infix declaration would be infix
    7 quot rem.

        Implementation note:

        This is the semantics of most hardware divide instructions, so
        quot may be faster than div.

i rem j

    returns the remainder of the division of i by j. It raises Div
    when j = 0. (i rem j) has the same sign as i, and it holds that

        (i quot j) * j + (i rem j) = i

    This is the semantics of most hardware divide instructions, so rem
    may be faster than mod.

compare (i, j)

    returns LESS, EQUAL, or GREATER when i is less than, equal to, or
    greater than j, respectively.

val < : int * int -> bool
val <= : int * int -> bool
val > : int * int -> bool
val >= : int * int -> bool

    These return true if the corresponding relation holds between the
    two integers.

~ i

    returns the negation of i, i.e., (0 - i). It raises Overflow when
    the result is not representable. This can happen, for example,
    when int is an n-bit 2's-complement integer type, and ~ is applied
    to -2 (n-1).

abs i

    returns the absolute value (magnitude) of i. It raises Overflow
    when the result is not representable.

val min : int * int -> int
val max : int * int -> int

    These return the smaller (respectively, larger) of the arguments.

sign i

    returns ~1, 0, or 1 when i is less than, equal to, or greater than
    0, respectively.

sameSign (i, j)

    returns true if i and j have the same sign. It is equivalent to
    (sign i = sign j).

fmt radix i
toString i

    These return a string containing a representation of i with #"~"
    used as the sign for negative numbers. The former formats the
    string according to radix, The hexadecimal digits 10 through 15
    are represented as #"A" through #"F", respectively. No prefix "0x"
    is generated for the hexadecimal representation. The second form
    is equivalent to fmt StringCvt.DEC i.

scan radix getc strm
fromString s

    The first expression returns SOME(i,rest) if an integer in the
    format denoted by radix can be parsed from a prefix of the
    character stream strm after skipping initial whitespace, where i
    is the value of the integer parsed and rest is the rest of the
    character stream. NONE is returned otherwise. This function raises
    Overflow when an integer can be parsed, but is too large to be
    represented by type int.

    The format that scan accepts depends on the radix
    argument. Regular expressions defining these formats are as
    follows:

	  Radix                 Format
	  StringCvt.BIN         [+~-]?[0-1]+
	  StringCvt.OCT         [+~-]?[0-7]+
	  StringCvt.DEC         [+~-]?[0-9]+
	  StringCvt.HEX         [+~-]?(0x | 0X)?[0-9a-fA-F]+

    Note that strings such as "0xg" and "0x 123" are scanned as
    SOME(0), even using a hexadecimal radix.

    The second expression returns SOME(i) if an integer i in the
    format [+~-]?[0-9]+ can be parsed from a prefix of the string s,
    ignoring initial whitespace; NONE is returned otherwise. The
    function fromString raises Overflow when an integer can be parsed,
    but is too large to fit in type int. It is equivalent to the
    expression StringCvt.scanString (scan StringCvt.DEC).
