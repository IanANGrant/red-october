Moscow ML requires Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 or XP. The
installation requires around 18 MB disk space.


INSTALLING MOSCOW ML (BINARIES ONLY) UNDER WINDOWS 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP

(1) Change directory to C:\ and unpack the Moscow ML distribution
    by executing

        unzip win32-mos20bin.zip

    NOTE: You must use a version of unzip that preserves long file
    names, such as Info-Zip or Winzip.

    This creates a directory C:\mosml with subdirectories

    mosml/              readme, install.txt
          bin/          mosml, mosmlc, mosmllex, mosmlyac, camlrunm,
                        and the dynamically loadable libraries
          copyrght/     copyright notices
          doc/          manual.pdf, mosmlref.pdf, mosmllib.pdf, ...
              mosmllib/ HTML-documentation of the Moscow ML library 
          examples/     a few example programs
          lib/          bytecode files and basis library units
          tools/        mosmldep, Makefile.stub

(2) Add C:\mosml\bin to the PATH variable, and set the environment
     variable `mosmllib' to C:\mosml\lib.  

    (a) In the case of Windows 95/98/ME your AUTOEXEC.BAT file should 
        contain something like:

          set PATH=C:\dos;  ...  ;C:\mosml\bin
          set MOSMLLIB=C:\mosml\lib

        The system must be rebooted to enable the new environment 
        variables. 

    (b) In the case of Windows NT/2000/XP, choose 
          Start | Settings | Control Panel | System | Advanced 
                | Environment Variables | System Variables | New
        Enter MOSMLLIB as Variable Name and C:\mosml\lib as Variable Value.
        Double-click on Path and add  ;C:\mosml\bin  to the Variable Value.

(3) Start Moscow ML by entering the command line

        mosml
    
To quit Moscow ML, type `quit();' or control-Z and return.

Moscow ML owes much to:
    * the CAML Light implementation by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez
      (INRIA, Rocquencourt, France); especially the Caml Light bytecode
      generator and the runtime system;
    * the ML Kit by Lars Birkedal, Nick Rothwell, Mads Tofte and David Turner
      (Copenhagen University, Denmark, and Edinburgh University, Scotland);
    * inspiration from the SML/NJ compiler developed at Princeton
      University and AT&T Bell Laboratories, New Jersey, USA; 
    * the good work by Doug Currie, Flavors Technology, USA, on the
      MacOS port and many improvements; and
    * feedback, contributions, and useful suggestions, in particular
      from Ken Friis Larsen, but also from Jonas Barklund, Mike Gordon,
      Michael Norrish, Konrad Slind, and numerous other people.
